<h3 id="desc">The Best Game Engine</h3>

You dont have to be a pro to make a game, all you need is a game developing software (Game Engine) and a good pc and you are good to go. In the past few years, i've learnt how to select the best engine despite moving a lot toward different Engines, i've tried 3D Rad, Game Editor, Game Maker, Godot, Unity, Silent Walk 2 and Silent Walk Renaisense,Game Studio A8, HTML-Javascript games all sorts of engines that i got my hand on. 
<br><br>

All of these engines where great but one thing that separates them from each other are the features. For example, if you are planning making a racing prototype game as fast as possible with no programming experience, i would prefer 3D Rad, but it has its flaws, you cant make a game for android using this game engine, therefore, you are limited.<br>
Choosing the best engine will require a proper begining, if you would want to know on how to make a game visit this page for more details <a href="read.php?t=how_to_make_video_games" target="_bank">[ How to make Video Games ]</a>. The proper Engine depends on what goals you are planning to achieve, the equipment that you are having. Some game Engines requires the most expensive equipments ever such that the outcomes are much appreciated. Did you know that the famous Warner Bros game, Mortal Kombat X was developed using Unreal Engine? Yes, you heard me right, you can have this software at your dispose through this link <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/" target="_bank">Unreal Engine</a> but note, if you are planning on using a laptop, it will die in the first three months, so prepare the best.
<br><br>

Basically,  everthing that you want to build will depend on the plan you are having. If you are planning on making a 3D game, dont expect using game maker or game editor, so you need a game engine that will fullfill 3D capabilities which could include Godot or Unity or Unreal. Choosing the right engine will help you achieve you goal in time.
<br>
Sometimes, in your plans, you might be planning on making an android game, as explained earlier, engines like 3D rad will not export for android therefore you might as well forget about using that engine. The best engine in this scenario is the one that can export to android without giving you headaches, I would prefer <a href="https://www.godotengine.org" target="_bank">Godot</a> as setting up for android on this engine is quite simpler and easier to setup. Moreover it will not require much effort and knowledge on Android to do so. Unity also can export to android, but since i have not quite rendered an apk from unity, thats why i am prefering to Godot.
<br>Maybe you are ambitious and want to make games for different console for example, the playstation, xbox, nintendo switch, Unity and Unreal are the best since they have been on the market for a longer period of time. Some engines like Godot do not yet support running on consoles but i do believe they will some day sooner, "our eyes are on you Juan Linietsky" < cant even pronounce the name properly.
<br><br>With these in mind, i believe i have captured all sides of finding your dream game engine, however, do you have any engines that i did not mention about? Comment in the comments section below and share your opinions.
