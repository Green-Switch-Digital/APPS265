So you want to make money from application development but it seems to be so hard! Sometimes you think you wasted time learning to write sofware right? No you did not! My name is Wongani Kaluwa and i have passed through the same conditions too but managed to make a few kwacha's from application development back then in 2017 while still in third year. <br> Making software is hard! and you know that, but whats even hard is to convience a Malawian to actually buy that software when they can go online and download for free, or even go and copy from a friends pc or phone and install it. Its that easy.
<br>
So What do you need to do to make money out of your own app? With the little experience i have gained through my 8 years (from 2020) of suffering, I have learnt the following few key points in making money from a software that you actually made. 
<br>&quot;Theres more to software development than writing code, W. Kaluwa (2017) [Innovation Enterpreneurship].&quot;

	<li><h3>Solve a real Problem</h3>
		<p style="width: 60%;">This is the first and most crucial step most upcoming programmers forget when they venture into programming. Most of us will go straight into coding when in real sense, we have no idea on what we are doing! <b>This is NOT safe</b> and you'll end up frustrated that ever and at the end wasting your time, but hey, we learn as we go right?<br>How do you solve a real problem? Its not that easy if you hate to do research and more research. You need to get to people, find out whats missing in their lives, try to get what they really want to use! In my opinion, people are not interested in fancy looking applications that do nothing! they want something that does the job and fast, so take this as an opportunity of not wasting time focusing on making things that looks nice but an app that solves the problem. I've done it and it made me almost MWK50,000.00 with around 30 users of my app. </p>

	<li><h3>Have a Scope AKA a Limit</h3>
		<p style="width: 60%;">When you start making applications, you will get all these ideas coming all the way, and they will seem to be cool and nice BUT do not implement those ideas until you finish the main objective of the application no matter how hard it seems to be! Those ideas are like the little whisper from the coding demon, they want to flood you head with seamingless ideas that will actually destroy your application for good. So after you have completed your main objective of the app, youre good to go</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Have a Team to Help You</h3>
		<p style="width: 60%;">Many developers in Malawi are known of one man operation that is why they do not actually make any progress in their lives, not at all. Team work is crucial when you want to make an app that will be used by diverse people so you should atleast avoid making your application one man centric as much as possible.<br>
			<br>My first application (Links Antivirus v1.0.0) was influenced by almost more than 10 people who helped a lot in its development life cycle, from the interface, system scanning etc. Had it not been for them, then i could have wasted a lot throughout the app development life cycle. so apps that makes money needs to have a diverse team to get it running.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Apreciate Negative Feedback and Embrance it</h3>
		<p style="width: 60%;">Lastly, once you have tested and deployed it, you can get all the feedback including the negatives one cause that what will make you app become much more better and best for the industry. <br><br>
			Dont forget to secure you application such that no one, even you can not share that easily. Thas bussiness now. If you want to know more, read my book <a href="htp://linkmein.byethost3.com/search.php?innovation">[Innovation and Enterpreneurship]</a> and tell me what you think.
