<p style="width: 80%;
margin-left: 2%;margin-right: 18%;float: left;">Everyone can now make a game, thanks to the free commercial use softwares developed by great programmers across the world. Back then, game development was a huge issue and only big companies line EA, Konami and Atari could only make franchise that we remember playing as kids. <br><br>Making games is fun yet very time consuming. What makes it fun is the fact that you get to create a world with your own rules where the player gets to follow those rules. If you are looking towards making a game, either in Malawi or across Africa, these are some of the guide lines, <br><br><span style="color: orange">NOTE :</span> <b><i>These arguments are based on personal experiences, feel free give out your ideas and arguments.</i></b><br><br>I have been making games since 2012, I've studyied many books, blogs, youtube videos just to know how to make playable game. Known Franchise i've helped to develop includes Bulle and the Biscuit Factory 1 and 2, Speed Syntax, Wormio and Fishilet etc. To start making games, follow the following steps

<ol>
	<li><h3>Create a concept</h3>
		<p style="width: 60%;">This is a written design or idea of the game. It describes the whole purpose of the game, the gameplay, the objectives, goals and lastly the target platorm If you are planning on Making a game thats enjoyable or playable, before starting to make the game itself, you must know what you are doing, this will help you to avoid getting more envolved later when making the game.<br>Most game developers gets their first want of making a game in the first week of development, if you miss out that feeling and never document it, it will probably roll out when you start development. In this stage, write down who will your character be, his strengths, weakness, abilities. Document how your players will play the game and how they will interact with the world and the objects around.</p>
	</li>

	<li><h3>Choose the game engine</h3>
		<p style="width: 60%;">This is the software that will help design your game. There are a lot of tools out there and if you would like to know more visit this page<a href="read.php?t=best_game_engine"> [Best Engine]</a><br>The game engine of your choice will depend on what are the characters objectives and which engine can handle that, for example if you are looking to make an fps (first person shooter) game, i would recoment Unreal Engine, however, if your computer cant handle it, try silent walk fps creator.</p>
	</li>

	<li><h3>Start making assets</h3>
		<p style="width: 60%;">Once you have your engine ready, its now time for you to start designing your game assets. These are the objects, players, enemies, sound effect background music etc. good thing there are a lot of free assets around but remember, if you use free assets, there is a chance someone else also used the same assets which might make it a little bit wierd. If you cant manage on your own, give yourself some time to learn or have a team to help you out. </p>

	<li><h3>Level Designing</h3>
		<p style="width: 60%;">Design your levels in this stage, the objectives of each level and how the player will use his abilities to pass through those levels. Make them challanging but yet achievable. Hard games frustrates the player so try to make them as friendly as possible.</p>
	</li>

	<li><h3>Start making the game!</h3>
		<p style="width: 60%;">Once the asserts are ready, its high time you start making the game, this involves writing code. This is the hardest part of all if you dont know how to code yet, but dont worry, most game engines has a drag and drop feature, for example game maker studio, Godot Visual Scripting etc that will help you move along this development processes. Dont forget to test and deploy in this stage, release a demo and send it to one of the Malawi game development community, either on facebook or WhatsApp to get some feedback and ideas from the pros.</p>
